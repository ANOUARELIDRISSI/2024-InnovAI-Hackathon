# *Tarkiz.ai* - Focus, Simplified by AI

## *Abstract*

### *Background and Problem Statement*

In today’s digital world, staying focused has become increasingly challenging. Students, professionals, and individuals with focus-related disorders, such as ADHD, often face significant struggles in managing distractions and maintaining attention while working or studying. 

- *For professionals, studies show that they lose **31% of their workday* to distractions such as social media, emails, and multitasking. 
- *For students, distractions can cause them to waste up to **2-3 hours daily*, which directly affects their academic performance.

Despite the availability of some productivity tools, most of these solutions fail to provide personalized feedback, real-time support, or structure, leaving individuals struggling to stay on track. 

*Tarkiz.ai* was created to address this challenge, offering an AI-driven solution that tracks individual behavior, provides real-time reminders, manages tasks, and adapts to users' needs to improve focus.
